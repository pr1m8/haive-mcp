## Prerequisites

- Python 3.13 or higher
- Azure CLI installed and configured
- Azure subscription and appropriate permissions
- Service Principal with required access

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd py-az-mcp
```

2. Install dependencies using `uv`:

```bash
uv pip sync
```

Or install directly from pyproject.toml:

```bash
uv pip install -e .
```

## Configuration

1. Create a Service Principal and configure environment variables by running the utility script:

```bash
python create_service_principal.py
```

This script will:

- Authenticate you with Azure interactively
- Create a new Service Principal with Contributor role
- Automatically generate a `.env` file with the required credentials:
  - AZURE_CLIENT_ID
  - AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET
  - AZURE_TENANT_ID
  - AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID

Note: The `.env` file is automatically excluded from git tracking for security purposes.

## Claude Desktop Configuration

To use this MCP server with Claude Desktop, configure the following:

1. Create or update the Claude Desktop configuration file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Azure": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--with",
        "mcp[cli]",
        "mcp",
        "run",
        "/your-path-to/py-az-mcp/server-azure.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The configuration file is located at:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- Linux: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

2. Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual system username in both paths.

3. Ensure your virtual environment is properly set up:

```bash
cd /Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Source/Code/py-az-mcp
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install mcp[cli]
```

4. Verify the configuration:
   - Open Claude Desktop
   - Click on the settings icon (⚙️)
   - Navigate to the "MCP Servers" section
   - The Azure server should be listed and enabled

Note: The server will start automatically when needed by Claude Desktop. Ensure all environment variables from the `.env` file are properly configured before using Azure commands through Claude.

## Usage

1. Start the MCP server:

```bash
uv run --with mcp[cli] mcp run server-azure.py
```

2. The server will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:6274`

### Example API Calls

List all subscriptions:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:6274/tool/azure-cli -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"command": "account list --output json"}'
```

List all resource groups:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:6274/tool/azure-cli -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"command": "group list --output json"}'
```

## Dependencies

- Python >= 3.13
- mcp[cli] >= 1.6.0
- python-dotenv >= 1.0.0
- asyncio >= 3.4.3
- Azure CLI >= 2.57.0 (system requirement)

## Project Structure

- `server-azure.py`: Main MCP server implementation with Azure CLI integration
- `create_service_principal.py`: Utility script for creating Azure Service Principal
- `main.py`: Package entry point (placeholder)
- `pyproject.toml`: Project dependencies and configuration
- `.env`: Environment variables configuration (not tracked in git)
- `.python-version`: Python version requirement

## Error Handling

The server includes comprehensive error handling:

- JSON validation for all responses
- Azure CLI error capture and formatting
- Authentication error handling
- Parameter validation

## Security Considerations

- Uses Service Principal authentication
- Supports environment variable configuration for sensitive data
- Implements proper error handling to prevent information disclosure
- Validates all input parameters
