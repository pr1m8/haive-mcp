# Backlog MCP Server

This is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for interacting with Backlog, a project management tool. The server provides tools to query and manage Backlog resources like projects, issues, wikis, and user activities.

## Features

- Retrieve Backlog space information
- List and search projects
- Search, view, and manage issues
- Access wiki pages
- View user activities and notifications
- Get user information

## Requirements

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- Backlog account with API key

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/digitalcube/advanced-backlog-mcp-server.git
cd advanced-backlog-mcp-server

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the server
npm run build
```

## Configuration

### Claude Desktop Setup

To use the Backlog MCP server with Claude Desktop, edit the following configuration file:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "advanced-backlog-mcp-server": {
      "command": "/path/to/advanced-backlog-mcp-server/build/index.js",
      "env": {
        "BACKLOG_DOMAIN": "your-domain.backlog.com",
        "BACKLOG_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Getting the Command Path

To get the correct path for the `command` field, run the following in the repository directory after building:

```bash
echo "\"$(pwd)/build/index.js\""
```

This will display the path to use in the `command` field.

Example: `"/Users/username/development/mcp-servers/advanced-backlog-mcp-server/build/index.js"`

On macOS, you can copy this directly to your clipboard with:

```bash
echo "\"$(pwd)/build/index.js\"" | pbcopy
```

### API Key Setup

You can get your API key from your Backlog account settings.

## Usage

After configuration, you can use the server with Claude Desktop or any other MCP-compatible client.

In Claude Desktop, you can use natural language queries such as:

- "Show me all my recent issues"
- "List all projects in my Backlog space"
- "Find issues assigned to me with a high priority"

- `list_backlog_space` - Get information about your Backlog space
