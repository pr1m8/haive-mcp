# OpenSearch

A Model Context Protocol server that provides read-only access to OpenSearch clusters. This server enables LLMs to inspect indices and execute read-only queries.

To learn more about MCP Servers see:

- [What is MCP](https://skeet.build/docs/guides/what-is-mcp)
- [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)

This OpenSearch MCP Server was designed for seamless integration with [skeet.build](https://skeet.build)

## Components

### Tools

- **search**
  - Execute read-only search queries against the connected OpenSearch cluster
  - Input: `query` (string): The OpenSearch query to execute
  - Input: `index` (string): The index to search (optional)
  - All queries are executed with read-only permissions

### Resources

The server provides schema information for each index in the OpenSearch cluster:

- **Index Mappings** (`opensearch://<host>/<index>/mapping`)
  - JSON schema information for each index
  - Includes field names and data types
  - Automatically discovered from cluster metadata

## Usage with Claude Desktop

        "https://username:password@localhost:9200"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Global Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "opensearch": {
      "command": "npx",
