# Shell Command MCP Server

Go server implementing Model Context Protocol (MCP) for executing shell commands.

## Features

- Execute shell commands using bash or zsh
- List previous command executions

## Usage with Claude Desktop

Install the server

```bash
go install github.com/gamunu/mcp-unix-shell
```

Add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "shell": {
      "command": "mcp-unix-shell",
      "args": ["--allowed-commands=ls,cat,echo,find"]
    }
  }
}
```

To allow all commands (use with caution):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "shell": {
      "command": "mcp-unix-shell",
      "args": ["--allowed-commands=*"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Security Considerations

When using this MCP server, please consider:

1. Only allow commands you trust - a restrictive allowlist is recommended
2. Avoid allowing commands that could modify system settings or access sensitive data
3. The server runs with the permissions of the user running Claude Desktop
4. Command output is sent back to the LLM, so be mindful of sensitive information
