## Configuration

Add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "mcp_email_reader": {
            "command": "uvx",
            "args": [
                "--from",
                "git+https://github.com/karateboss/mcp_email_reader@main",
                "mcp_email_reader"
            ],
        "env": {
            "IMAP_SERVER": "<email server>",
            "EMAIL_ACCOUNT": "<user email account>",
            "EMAIL_PASSWORD_ENC": "<encrypted password>"
            "EMAIL_SECRET_KEY": "<secret key used to encypt password>"
        }
    }
}
```

Note: Clearly, the secret key can be used to decrypt the encrypted password and is therefore a potential security risk - although claude_desktop_config.json is stored locally on your laptop/PC. It has been added to the json file above since it is not possible to add a .env file when using uvx to clone the repo dynamically.
