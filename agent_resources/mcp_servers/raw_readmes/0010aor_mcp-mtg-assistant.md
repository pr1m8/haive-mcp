# MCP Server MTG Assistant

A Model Context Protocol server that provides Magic: The Gathering card information fetching capabilities using the Scryfall API.

### Example Rules Question Workflow

While primarily used for looking up specific card details, this server can also be a crucial first step in answering MTG rules questions.

**User Query:** "If I cast a Finale of Devastation with X=10 and search for an Avenger of Zendikar, do the tokens also get +10/+10 and haste, or not?"

### Available Tools

- `get_mtg_card_info` - Retrieves details for a specific Magic: The Gathering card from Scryfall.
  - `query` (string, required): The search query string (e.g., card name, partial name, characteristics).

## Installation and Running

This project uses [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management and running scripts.

### Using uv (recommended)

Ensure `uv` is installed. You can run the server directly from the project directory:

```bash
# Navigate to the project root directory first
cd path/to/mcp-servers/mcp-mtg-assistant

# Install dependencies (if needed) and run the server script
uv run mcp-server-mtg-assistant
```

### Using PIP (for distribution or alternative setup)

If the package were published, you could install it via pip:

```bash
pip install mcp-server-mtg-assistant
```

After installation, you could run it as a script:

```bash
python -m mcp_server_mtg_assistant
```

For development, you typically run it using `uv run` as shown above.

## Configuration

### Configure for MCP Clients (e.g., Claude.app, Inspector)

Add an entry to your client's MCP server configuration. The exact key (`"mtg-assistant"` in the examples) can be chosen by you.

**Important:** The configuration needs to point `uv` to the correct project directory using the `--directory` argument. The path style (`/` vs `\`) depends on your operating system and how you run `uv`.

<details>
<summary>Default: Using uv Directly (Linux/macOS/WSL)</summary>

This is the standard approach if your MCP client and the server run in the same Linux, macOS, or WSL environment.

```json
// Example for mcp.json or Claude settings
"mcpServers": {
  "mtg-assistant": {
    "command": "uv",
    "args": [
      "--directory",
      "/path/to/mcp-servers/mcp-mtg-assistant", // Unix-style path
      "run",
      "mcp-server-mtg-assistant"
    ]
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Windows Client + WSL Server</summary>

This configuration is **recommended** if your MCP client runs on **Windows**, but you want the server to execute within **WSL** It uses `wsl.exe` to invoke `uv` inside WSL.

**Requirements:**

- `uv` must be installed _inside_ your WSL distribution.
- Adjust the path to `uv` inside WSL (e.g., `/home/user/.cargo/bin/uv`) if it's not in the WSL `PATH`.
- Use the `/mnt/...` style path for the `--directory` argument accessible from within WSL.

```json
// Example for mcp.json or Claude settings on Windows
"mcpServers": {
  "mtg-assistant": {
    "command": "wsl.exe",
    "args": [
      "/home/your-user/.cargo/bin/uv", // uv WSL PATH
      "--directory",
      "/mnt/d/repos/mcp-servers/mcp-mtg-assistant", // WSL-style path to project
      "run",
      "mcp-server-mtg-assistant"
    ]
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Alternative: Using uv Directly on Windows</summary>

This assumes `uv` is installed directly on Windows and your MCP client also runs directly on Windows.

- Use the Windows-style path (`D:\...`) for the `--directory` argument.
- Be mindful of potential `.venv` conflicts if you also use WSL (see below).

```json
// Example for mcp.json or Claude settings on Windows
"mcpServers": {
  "mtg-assistant": {
    "command": "uv",
    "args": [
      "--directory",
      "D:\path\to\mcp-servers\mcp-mtg-assistant", // Windows-style path
      "run",
      "mcp-server-mtg-assistant"
    ]
  }
}
```

</details>

### Handling `.venv` Conflicts (Different Environments)

- **Problem:** `uv run` creates a `.venv` directory specific to the operating system/environment (e.g., Linux vs. Windows). If you switch between running the server directly on Windows and running it via WSL (or native Linux), the existing `.venv` might be incompatible.
- **Solution:** Before switching environments, **delete the `.venv` directory** in the `mcp-mtg-assistant` project root. `uv run` will then create a fresh, compatible one for the environment you are using.

## Debugging

You can use the MCP inspector to debug the server by prefixing the command and arguments from your configuration with `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector`.

```bash
# Example using the Default (Linux/macOS/WSL) configuration:
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv --directory /path/to/mcp-servers/mcp-mtg-assistant run mcp-server-mtg-assistant

# Example using the Recommended (Windows Client + WSL Server) configuration:
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector wsl.exe /home/your-user/.cargo/bin/uv --directory /mnt/d/repos/mcp-servers/mcp-mtg-assistant run mcp-server-mtg-assistant

# Example using the Alternative (Direct Windows) configuration:
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv --directory D:\path\to\mcp-servers\mcp-mtg-assistant run mcp-server-mtg-assistant
```
