## Troubleshooting

### MCP Server Not Starting

If the MCP server fails to start:

```bash
node /path/to/claude-google-images-mcp/server.js

3. Verify the Claude Desktop configuration:

```bash
cat "~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json"
```

(Adjust the path for your operating system)
