# Dockerized Claude Code MCP Server

A simple Docker container for running Claude Code MCP server with enhanced security features.

## Development Environment

This Docker container provides a pre-configured development environment with:

- **Base OS**: Ubuntu
- **Build Tools**: git, curl, wget, etc.
- **Security**: Network firewall to prevent unauthorized outbound connections

You can customize the Dockerfile to add additional development tools or languages specific to your projects.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Build Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t my-claude-mcp:latest .
```

Or if you have [just](https://github.com/casey/just) installed:

```bash
just build
```

### 2. MCP Client Configuration

#### (Example) Claude Desktop Configuration

Configure Claude Desktop settings file (`~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on macOS for example) as follows:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "claude-code": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "--cap-add=NET_ADMIN",
        "-v",
        "/Users/username/.claude:/home/claude/.claude",
        "-v",
        "/Users/username/project-1:/workspace/project-1",
        "-v",
        "/Users/username/project-2:/workspace/project-2",
        "my-claude-mcp:latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

This configuration:

- Mounts your Claude settings directory (`~/.claude`)
- Mounts your project directories for access within the container
- Gives you the flexibility to add as many project directories as needed

## Customization

Feel free to modify the Dockerfile to add more development tools based on your needs. For example:

- Additional programming languages (Go, Python, etc.)
- Database clients
- Cloud CLIs (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Container tools (Docker, Kubernetes tools)

After modifying the Dockerfile, rebuild the image with:

```bash
docker build -t my-claude-mcp:latest .
```

Or with just:

```bash
just build
```

## Environment Variables

The container supports the following environment variables:

| Variable         | Description                   | Default | Required |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- | ------- | -------- |
| `GIT_USER_NAME`  | User name for Git commits     | Claude  | No       |
| `GIT_USER_EMAIL` | Email address for Git commits | None    | No       |

## Security Features

This container includes a network firewall that restricts outbound connections to only approved domains:

- GitHub domains (api.github.com, github.com, etc.)
- NPM registry (registry.npmjs.org)
- Anthropic APIs (api.anthropic.com, statsig.anthropic.com)
- Other required services (sentry.io, etc.)

The firewall is automatically enabled when the container is started with the necessary capabilities (`--cap-add=NET_ADMIN`). These capabilities are **required** for the container to run - if they are not provided, the container will exit immediately for security reasons.

Key security features:

- Firewall configuration is handled by the root user
- Claude Code MCP runs as a non-root user (claude) without sudo privileges
- Strict firewall rules prevent unauthorized network access
- Automatic verification of firewall configuration during startup

This security feature helps prevent potential data exfiltration attempts through the MCP server.
