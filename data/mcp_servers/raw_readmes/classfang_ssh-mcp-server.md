# 🔐 ssh-mcp-server

SSH-based MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that allows remote execution of SSH commands via the MCP protocol.

English Document | [中文文档](README_CN.md)

## 📝 Project Overview

ssh-mcp-server is a bridging tool that enables AI assistants and other applications supporting the MCP protocol to execute remote SSH commands through a standardized interface. This allows AI assistants to safely operate remote servers, execute commands, and retrieve results without directly exposing SSH credentials to AI models.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🔒 Secure Connections**: Supports multiple secure SSH connection methods, including password authentication and private key authentication (with passphrase support)
- **🛡️ Command Security Control**: Precisely control the range of allowed commands through flexible blacklist and whitelist mechanisms to prevent dangerous operations
- **🔄 Standardized Interface**: Complies with MCP protocol specifications for seamless integration with AI assistants supporting the protocol
- **📂 File Transfer**: Supports bidirectional file transfers, uploading local files to servers or downloading files from servers
- **🔑 Credential Isolation**: SSH credentials are managed entirely locally and never exposed to AI models, enhancing security
- **🚀 Ready to Use**: Can be run directly using NPX without global installation, making it convenient and quick to deploy

## 📚 Usage

### 🔧 MCP Configuration Examples

#### ⚙️ Command Line Options

```text
Options:
  -h, --host          SSH server host address
  -p, --port          SSH server port
  -u, --username      SSH username
  -w, --password      SSH password
  -k, --privateKey    SSH private key file path
  -P, --passphrase    Private key passphrase (if any)
  -W, --whitelist     Command whitelist, comma-separated regular expressions
  -B, --blacklist     Command blacklist, comma-separated regular expressions
```

#### 🔑 Using Password

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ssh-mpc-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@fangjunjie/ssh-mcp-server",
        "--host 192.168.1.1",
        "--port 22",
        "--username root",
        "--password pwd123456"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### 🔐 Using Private Key

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ssh-mpc-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@fangjunjie/ssh-mcp-server",
        "--host 192.168.1.1",
        "--port 22",
        "--username root",
        "--privateKey ~/.ssh/id_rsa"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### 🔏 Using Private Key with Passphrase

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ssh-mpc-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@fangjunjie/ssh-mcp-server",
        "--host 192.168.1.1",
        "--port 22",
        "--username root",
        "--privateKey ~/.ssh/id_rsa",
        "--passphrase pwd123456"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### 📝 Using Command Whitelist and Blacklist

Use the `--whitelist` and `--blacklist` parameters to restrict the range of executable commands. Multiple patterns are separated by commas. Each pattern is a regular expression used to match commands.

Example: Using Command Whitelist

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ssh-mpc-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@fangjunjie/ssh-mcp-server",
        "--host 192.168.1.1",
        "--port 22",
        "--username root",
        "--password pwd123456",
        "--whitelist ^ls( .*)?,^cat .*,^df.*"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Example: Using Command Blacklist

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ssh-mpc-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@fangjunjie/ssh-mcp-server",
        "--host 192.168.1.1",
        "--port 22",
        "--username root",
        "--password pwd123456",
        "--blacklist ^rm .*,^shutdown.*,^reboot.*"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

> Note: If both whitelist and blacklist are specified, the system will first check whether the command is in the whitelist, and then check whether it is in the blacklist. The command must pass both checks to be executed.
