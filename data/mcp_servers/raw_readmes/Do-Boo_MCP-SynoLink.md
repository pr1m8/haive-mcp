- Network access to your Synology NAS

## Installation

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Do-Boo/MCP-SynoLink.git
cd MCP-SynoLink
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Build the project:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Usage with Claude Desktop

### Node.js Method

Add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "synolink": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/MCP-SynoLink/dist/index.js",
        "https://your-synology-url:port",
        "your-username",
        "your-password"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Docker Method

Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t mcp/synolink .
```

Then add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "synolink": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "mcp/synolink",
        "https://your-synology-url:port",
        "your-username",
        "your-password"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Security Note

Always be careful with credentials. The current implementation sends the password as a command-line argument, which may be visible in process listings. For improved security in a production environment, consider implementing alternative authentication methods.
