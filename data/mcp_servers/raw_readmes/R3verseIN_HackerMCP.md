# HackerMCP

HackerMCP is a module built for AI assistants to access and utilize common penetration testing and security tools. This module enables AI systems to leverage powerful security tools through a simple interface.

## Currently Supported Tools

- **Nmap**: Network discovery and security auditing
- **Metasploit Framework**: Penetration testing framework

## Future Goals

- Add support for SQLMap
- Expand available security tools and capabilities

## Installation

Add the following configuration to your MCP configuration file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hackermcp": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["--directory", "~/dir/to/hackermcp", "run", "hacker.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `~/dir/to/hackermcp` with the actual path to the hackermcp directory.

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Nmap installed on your system
- Metasploit Framework installed on your system

### Virtual Environment Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/R3verseIN/HackerMCP
   cd HackerMCP
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment using `uv`:

   ```bash
   uv venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Installing UV

If you don't have the `uv` package manager then install it:

```bash
pip3 install uv
```

Or use curl to download the installation script:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

If your system doesn't have curl, you can use wget:

```bash
wget -qO- https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```
