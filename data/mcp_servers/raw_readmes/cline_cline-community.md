# Cline Community MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol server that simplifies reporting issues from Cline to GitHub.

## Overview

This MCP server provides tools to streamline the process of reporting issues from Cline to the GitHub repository. It automatically gathers relevant system information (OS, Cline version, API provider, model), formats it alongside the user's issue description, and can preview how the issue would look before submitting it to GitHub.

## Features

- **Cross-platform support**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Multiple IDE support**: Compatible with VS Code, Cursor, and Windsurf
- **Automatic metadata extraction**: Gets API provider, model, and IDE information from task metadata
- **Two-step issue reporting workflow**:
  1. Preview the issue before submission
  2. Submit to GitHub with a single command
- **GitHub Integration**: Uses the GitHub CLI (`gh`) to create issues

## Tools

### `preview_cline_issue`

Previews how an issue would look when reported to GitHub without actually submitting it. This should be in the autoApprove list by default

**Parameters**:

- `title`: The title for the GitHub issue (required)
- `description`: Detailed description of the problem (required)
- `labels`: Optional array of GitHub labels to apply

**Returns**: JSON object containing the formatted issue with:

- Title
- Body (including system information)
- Labels
- Target repository

### `report_cline_issue`

Reports an issue to the GitHub repository using the locally authenticated GitHub CLI.

**Parameters**:

- `title`: The title for the GitHub issue (required)
- `description`: Detailed description of the problem (required)
- `labels`: Optional array of GitHub labels to apply

**Returns**: The URL of the created GitHub issue or an error message

## Automatic Information Gathering

The server automatically collects:

- **OS Information**: Platform and release version
- **Cline Version**: Detected from installed extensions
- **IDE Information**: Identifies which IDE is being used (VS Code, Cursor, or Windsurf)
- **API Provider**: Extracted from the task metadata file
- **Model**: Extracted from the task metadata file

## Requirements

- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated
- Access to task metadata directories (where Cline stores information about the current task)

## Installation

### Clone the repo

```
git clone git@github.com:cline/cline-community.git
```

or if you are sure you have the gh cli,

```
gh repo clone cline/cline-community
```

### Build from Source

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the server
npm run build
```

### Authenticate with GH CLI

This MCP server relies on the authentication status of your installed GitHub CLI (`gh`). Ensure you are logged in:

```bash
# Check to see if the user is already authenticated
gh auth status
```

If they are not authenticated, take the following steps:

```bash
# Log in to GitHub
gh auth login
```

1. Select GitHub.com for where you use GitHub

```
? Where do you use GitHub?  [Use arrows to move, type to filter]
> GitHub.com
  Other
```

2. Select HTTPS for your your preferred protocol

```
? What is your preferred protocol for Git operations on this host?  [Use arrows to move, type to filter]
> HTTPS
  SSH
```

3. Indicate Yes that you want to authenticate

`? Authenticate Git with your GitHub credentials? (Y/n)`

4. Select Login with a web browser

```
? How would you like to authenticate GitHub CLI?  [Use arrows to move, type to filter]
> Login with a web browser
  Paste an authentication token
```

5. Copy your one-time code

```
! First copy your one-time code: XXXX-XXXX
Press Enter to open https://github.com/login/device in your browser...
```

6. Presss Enter

7. Login in the bowser

8. Enter the code that you copied

9. Continue

10. Get your token

```bash
# get your token
gh auth token
```

11. Save it to the envobject in your cline_mcp_settings.json

12. You're ready to use cline community!

### Configure with Cline

Add the server to your MCP settings:

#### For Cline in VS Code/Cursor

Add to Cline MCP settings:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/[Code|Cursor|Windsurf]/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/[Code|Cursor|Windsurf]/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/[Code|Cursor|Windsurf]/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cline-community": {
      "autoApprove": ["preview_cline_issue"],
      "timeout": 10,
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/cline-community/build/index.js"],
      "transportType": "stdio",
      "env": {
        "GH_TOKEN": "YOUR TOKEN HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Windows-Specific Configuration

On Windows, you may need to explicitly set the APPDATA environment variable in the MCP settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cline-community": {
      "autoApprove": ["preview_cline_issue"],
      "timeout": 10,
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/cline-community/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "APPDATA": "C:\\Users\\[username]\\AppData\\Roaming"
      },
      "env": {
        "GH_TOKEN": "YOUR TOKEN HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `[username]` with your Windows username.

## Usage Example

To report an issue:

1. Use `preview_cline_issue` first to see how your issue will look:

   ```
   preview_cline_issue(
     title: "Feature request: Add dark mode",
     description: "It would be great to have a dark mode option to reduce eye strain.",
     labels: ["Enhancement"]
   )
   ```

2. Review the preview and then submit with:
   ```
   report_cline_issue(
     title: "Feature request: Add dark mode",
     description: "It would be great to have a dark mode option to reduce eye strain.",
     labels: ["Enhancement"]
   )
   ```

## Development

For development with auto-rebuild:

```bash
npm run watch
```

### Debugging

Since MCP servers communicate over stdio, use the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector) for debugging:

```bash
npm run inspector
```
