## Installation

1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arindam200/devto-mcp.git
cd devto-mcp
```

2. **Connect to the MCP server**

   Copy the below json with the appropriate {{PATH}} values:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "devto": {
         "command": "{{PATH_TO_UV}}", // Run `which uv` and place the output here
         "args": [
           "--directory",
           "{{PATH_TO_SRC}}", // cd into the repo, run `pwd` and enter the output here
           "run",
           "server.py"
         ],
         "env": {
           "DEV_TO_API_KEY": "Your Dev.to API Key" // Get it from https://dev.to/settings/extensions.
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   You can obtain a Dev.to API key from your [Dev.to settings page](https://dev.to/settings/extensions).

   For **Claude**, save this as `claude_desktop_config.json` in your Claude Desktop configuration directory at:

   ```
   ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
   ```

   For **Cursor**, save this as `mcp.json` in your Cursor configuration directory at:

   ```
   ~/.cursor/mcp.json
   ```

3. **Restart Claude Desktop / Cursor**

   Open Claude Desktop and you should now see Devto as an available integration.

   Or restart Cursor.
