## Detailed Usage

### With Claude Desktop

After setting up the configuration file as shown in the Quick Start section, you can use the Mixpanel analytics capabilities directly in your conversations with Claude.

Examples of prompts you can use:

- "Track a custom event in Mixpanel named 'document_generated' for user 'user123'"
- "Track a page view for the homepage in Mixpanel"
- "Create a new user profile in Mixpanel for John Doe with email john@example.com"
- "Update user profile information in Mixpanel for user 'user123'"

Claude will use the appropriate Mixpanel MCP tool based on your request.

### With Other MCP Clients

This server uses the standard Model Context Protocol and can be integrated with any MCP client:

1. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npx mixpanel-mcp-server --token YOUR_MIXPANEL_TOKEN
   ```

2. Connect your MCP client to the server using stdio transport

3. The client can discover and use the available tools (mixpanel_track_event, mixpanel_track_pageview, mixpanel_track_signup, mixpanel_set_user_profile)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Server not starting:**

   - Ensure you've provided a valid Mixpanel token
   - Check that Node.js is installed and is version 16 or higher

2. **Claude Desktop not showing Mixpanel tools:**

   - Verify your claude_desktop_config.json file syntax
   - Make sure you've restarted Claude Desktop after editing the config
   - Check that the path to the server is correct

3. **Events not appearing in Mixpanel:**
   - Verify your Mixpanel token is correct
   - Check your Mixpanel project settings to ensure data is being received
   - Events may take a few minutes to appear in the Mixpanel interface

### Debug Mode

To run the server in debug mode for more verbose logging:

```bash
npx mixpanel-mcp-server --token YOUR_MIXPANEL_TOKEN --debug
```

## Security Notes

- Your Mixpanel token is stored in the Claude Desktop configuration file. Ensure this file has appropriate permissions
- Consider using environment variables for sensitive tokens in production environments
- This server does not implement rate limiting - consider adding additional security measures for production use
- Events are sent directly to Mixpanel's API - review Mixpanel's privacy policy for data handling practices
