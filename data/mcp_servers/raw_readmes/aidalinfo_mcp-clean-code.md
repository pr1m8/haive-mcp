## Tool

### cleancode

Facilitates clean code planning with a focus on readability, maintainability, and well-structured English comments.

**Inputs:**

- `thought` (string): Your current code planning step

- `thoughtNumber` (integer): Current step number
- `totalThoughts` (integer): Estimated total steps needed
- `isRevision` (boolean, optional): Whether this revises a previous planning step
- `revisesThought` (integer, optional): Which step is being reconsidered
- `branchFromThought` (integer, optional): Branching point step number for alternative approach
- `branchId` (string, optional): Alternative implementation identifier
- `needsMoreThoughts` (boolean, optional): If more planning steps are needed

## Configuration

### Usage with Claude Desktop

Add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

#### npm installation

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cleancode": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-clean-code"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Manual installation

```bash
# Install from npm
npm install -g mcp-clean-code

# Then use in configuration
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cleancode": {
      "command": "mcp-clean-code"
    }
  }
}
```

#### PNPM installation

```bash
# Install from npm using PNPM
pnpm add -g mcp-clean-code

# Then use in configuration
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cleancode": {
      "command": "mcp-clean-code"
    }
  }
}
```

#### docker

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cleancode": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "--rm", "-i", "mcp-clean-code"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Building

Docker:

```bash
docker build -t mcp-clean-code .
```

From source:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mcp-clean-code.git
cd mcp-clean-code

# Install dependencies and build
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

## GitHub Actions CI/CD

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically publishes the package to npm when a new release is created.

### Setting up for automatic npm publishing

To enable automatic publishing to npm, you need to add an NPM_TOKEN secret to your GitHub repository:

1. Generate an npm access token:

   - Go to npmjs.com and log in
   - Click on your profile picture in the top right corner and select "Access Tokens"
   - Click "Generate New Token" and choose the "Publish" option
   - Copy the generated token

2. Add the token to your GitHub repository:

   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Click on "Settings" > "Secrets and variables" > "Actions"
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - Name: `NPM_TOKEN`
   - Value: Paste the token you copied from npm
   - Click "Add secret"

3. Create a new release:
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Click on "Releases" > "Create a new release"
   - Choose a tag version (e.g., v1.0.0)
   - Add a release title and description
   - Click "Publish release"

The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically trigger, build the package, and publish it to npm.
