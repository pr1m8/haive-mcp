# Hubspot-MCP 🤖

Documentation for Streamlining the process of Integrating existing MCP server into a Hubspot Database

# Pre-requisites

- Hubspot access token containing required read/write permissions on a private app.
- Cursor Application to access the MCP server and talk with LLM.

# Setting up Hubspot

1. Go to [Hubspot](https://www.hubspot.com/) and make an account.
2. In Hubspot, Open `Settings > Integrations > Create private app`.
3. Provide the Basic Information of the private app.
4. In scopes, click `Add new scope` make sure the following are selected:

- `crm.objects.contacts` (read and write)
- `crm.objects.companies` (read and write)

5. After the scopes are added, click `Create app`.
6. Again open `Private apps` and view access token. Save it in a secure place. We will use it in the MCP Integration.

# Setting up Cursor

1. Download [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) and setup the project folder.
2. Go to `settings > MCP > add new global MCP Server`
3. Paste the following in it, and make sure to include your `Hubspot Access token`:

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hubspot": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "buryhuang/mcp-hubspot:latest",
        "--access-token",
        "<Your Access Token here>"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

# Access Check

We can use the below prompts to check if everything went well or failed.

### Check the Access Token Validity

```
Test if the current access token is valid by making a minimal authenticated request to the HubSpot MCP Server.
