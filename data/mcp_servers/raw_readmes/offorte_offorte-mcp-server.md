# Offorte MCP Server <!-- omit in toc -->

MCP server for Offorte - Create & send proposals using AI.

This server acts as the bridge between AI agents and Offorte's proposal engine.
It enables external models to create and send proposals via Offorte.
Built for automation workflows, the [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) makes it easy to integrate proposal actions into AI tools, chat interfaces, and autonomous systems.

> **Early technology**
> Please note that MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a new approach to AI integration.
> While powerful, it's still evolving and may occasionally produce unexpected or undesired results.

See how Offorte connects voice and workflow in [this real demo](https://www.offorte.com/en/blog/proposal-software/handsfree-proposal-sending-with-mcp).

## Goals & Coverage

The goal of this project is too create & send proposals using AI via the protocol.
Because of the experimental character, the full Offorte API is not covered and its limited to the tools needed to create & send proposals.
Tools which could lead to an LLM updating and deleting stuff are not yet implemented.
Update and delete commands might be added in the future, based on reallife results & user feedback.
