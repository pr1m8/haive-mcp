# Molecule-MCP

**Molecule-MCP**: A model-context-protocol server for molecules.
Molecule-MCP connects molecule science releated tools to Claude AI through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing Claude to **directly interact with and control these tools and act as a co-scientist**. This integration enables prompt assisted molecule modeling.

## Installation

⚠️ **Note**: Molecule-MCP requires Claude Desktop to be installed and running.

1. Go to Claude > Settings > Developer > Edit Config > claude_desktop_config.json to include the following:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pymol": {
      "command": "/path/to/mcp",
      "args": ["run", "/path/to/molecule-mcp/pymol_server.py"]
    },
    "chimerax": {
      "command": "/path/to/mcp",
      "args": ["run", "/path/to/molecule-mcp/ChimeraX_server.py"]
    },
    "gromacs_copilot": {
      "command": "/path/to/mcp",
      "args": ["run", "/path/to/molecule-mcp/mcp_server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

2. Install mcp and get the script

```bash
pip install "mcp[cli]" chatmol
pip install git+https://github.com/ChatMol/gromacs_copilot.git # optional, for running gromacs_copilot
which mcp
```

the path to mcp will be displayed. Copy this path for the next step and replace `/path/to/mcp` with the path to mcp.

```
git clone https://github.com/ChatMol/molecule-mcp.git
cd molecule-mcp
pwd
```

the path to molecule-mcp will be displayed. Copy this path for the next step and replace `/path/to/molecule-mcp` with the path to molecule-mcp.
