[MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is an open protocol introduced by Anthropic that standardizes how large language models communicate with external tools, resources or remote services.

> [!CAUTION] > **Beta Software Notice: This software is currently in beta and is provided AS IS without any warranties.**
>
> - Features, APIs, and functionality may change at any time without notice
> - Not recommended for production use or critical workloads
> - Support during the beta period is limited

The Auth0 MCP Server integrates with LLMs and AI agents, allowing you to perform various Auth0 management operations using natural language. For instance, you could simply ask Claude Desktop to perform Auth0 management operations:

- > Create a new Auth0 app and get the domain and client ID
- > Create and deploy a new Auth0 action to generate a JWT token
- > Could you check Auth0 logs for logins from 192.108.92.3 IP address?

## 🚀 Getting Started

**Prerequisites:**

- [Node.js v18 or higher](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) or any other [MCP Client](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients)
- [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) account with appropriate permissions

<br/>

### Install the Auth0 MCP Server

Install Auth0 MCP Server and configure it to work with your preferred MCP Client. The `--tools` parameter specifies which tools should be available (defaults to `*` if not provided).

**Claude Desktop with all tools**

```bash
npx @auth0/auth0-mcp-server init
```

**Claude Desktop with read-only tools**

```bash
npx @auth0/auth0-mcp-server init --read-only
```

You can also explicitly select read-only tools:

```bash
npx @auth0/auth0-mcp-server init --tools 'auth0_list_*,auth0_get_*'
```

**Windsurf**

```bash
npx @auth0/auth0-mcp-server init --client windsurf
```

**Cursor**

```bash
npx @auth0/auth0-mcp-server init --client cursor
```

**With limited tools access**

```bash
npx @auth0/auth0-mcp-server init --client cursor --tools 'auth0_list_applications,auth0_get_application'
```

**Other MCP Clients**

To use Auth0 MCP Server with any other MCP Client, you can manually add this configuration to the client and restart for changes to take effect:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "auth0": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@auth0/auth0-mcp-server", "run"],
      "capabilities": ["tools"],
      "env": {
        "DEBUG": "auth0-mcp"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You can add `--tools '<pattern>'` to the args array to control which tools are available. See [Security Best Practices](#-security-best-practices-for-tool-access) for recommended patterns.

### Authorize with Auth0

Your browser will automatically open to initiate the OAuth 2.0 device authorization flow. Log into your Auth0 account and grant the requested permissions.

> [!NOTE]
> Credentials are securely stored in your system's keychain. You can optionally verify storage through your keychain management tool. Check out [Authentication](#-authentication) for more info.

### Verify your integration

Restart your MCP Client (Claude Desktop, Windsurf, Cursor, etc.) and ask it to help you manage your Auth0 tenant

### 🔒 Security Best Practices for Tool Access

When configuring the Auth0 MCP Server, it's important to follow security best practices by limiting tool access based on your specific needs. The server provides flexible configuration options that let you control which tools AI assistants can access.

You can easily restrict tool access using the `--tools` and `--read-only` flags when starting the server:

```bash
# Enable only read-only operations
npx @auth0/auth0-mcp-server run --read-only

# Alternative way to enable only read-only operations
npx @auth0/auth0-mcp-server run --tools 'auth0_list_*,auth0_get_*'

# Limit to just application-related tools
npx @auth0/auth0-mcp-server run --tools 'auth0_*_application*'

# Limit to read-only application-related tools
# Note: --read-only takes priority when used with --tools
npx @auth0/auth0-mcp-server run --tools 'auth0_*_application*' --read-only

# Restrict to only log viewing capabilities
npx @auth0/auth0-mcp-server run --tools 'auth0_list_logs,auth0_get_log'

# Run the server with all tools enabled
npx @auth0/auth0-mcp-server run --tools '*'
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When both `--read-only` and `--tools` flags are used together, the `--read-only` flag takes priority for security. This means even if your `--tools` pattern matches non-read-only tools, only read-only operations will be available. This ensures you can rely on the `--read-only` flag as a security guardrail.

This approach offers several important benefits:

1. **Enhanced Security**: By limiting available tools to only what's needed, you reduce the potential attack surface and prevent unintended modifications to your Auth0 tenant.

2. **Better Performance**: Providing fewer tools to AI assistants actually improves performance. When models have access to many tools, they use more of their context window to reason about which tools to use. With a focused set of tools, you'll get faster and more relevant responses.

3. **Resource-Based Access Control**: You can configure different instances of the MCP server with different tool sets based on specific needs - development environments might need full access, while production environments could be limited to read operations only.

4. **Simplified Auditing**: With limited tools, it's easier to track which operations were performed through the AI assistant.

For most use cases, start with the minimum set of tools needed and add more only when required. This follows the principle of least privilege - a fundamental security best practice.

### 🧪 Security Scanning

We recommend regularly scanning this server, and any other MCP-compatible servers you deploy, with community tools built to surface protocol-level risks and misconfigurations.

These scanners help identify issues across key vulnerability classes including: server implementation bugs, tool definition and lifecycle risks, interaction and data flow weaknesses, and configuration or environment gaps.

Useful tools include:

- **[mcpscan.ai](https://mcpscan.ai)**  
  Web-based scanner that inspects live MCP endpoints for exposed tools, schema enforcement gaps, and other issues.

- **[mcp-scan](https://github.com/invariantlabs-ai/mcp-scan)**  
  CLI tool that simulates attack paths and evaluates server behavior from a client perspective.

These tools are not a substitute for a full audit, but they offer meaningful guardrails and early warnings. We suggest including them in your regular security review process.

If you discover a vulnerability, please follow our [responsible disclosure process](https://auth0.com/whitehat).

## 🕸️ Architecture

The Auth0 MCP Server implements the Model Context Protocol, allowing Claude to:

1. Request a list of available Auth0 tools
2. Call specific tools with parameters
3. Receive structured responses from the Auth0 Management API

The server handles authentication, request validation, and secure communication with the Auth0 Management API.

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://cdn.auth0.com/website/mcp/assets/auth0-mcp-server-hld.png" alt="Auth0 MCP Server HLD" width="800">
</div>

> [!NOTE]
> The server operates as a local process that connects to Claude Desktop, enabling secure communication without exposing your Auth0 credentials.

## 🔐 Authentication

The Auth0 MCP Server uses the Auth0 Management API and requires authentication to access your Auth0 tenant.

### Initial Setup

To authenticate the MCP Server:

```bash
npx @auth0/auth0-mcp-server init
```

This will start the device authorization flow, allowing you to log in to your Auth0 account and select the tenant you want to use.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `init` command needs to be run whenever:
>
> - You're setting up the MCP Server for the first time
> - You've logged out from a previous session
> - You want to switch to a different tenant
> - Your token has expired
>
> The `run` command will automatically check for token validity before starting the server and will provide helpful error messages if authentication is needed.

### Session Management

To see information about your current authentication session:

```bash
npx @auth0/auth0-mcp-server session
```

### Logging Out

For security best practices, always use the logout command when you're done with a session:

```bash
npx @auth0/auth0-mcp-server logout
```

This ensures your authentication tokens are properly removed from the system keychain.

### Authentication Flow

The server uses OAuth 2.0 device authorization flow for secure authentication with Auth0. Your credentials are stored securely in your system's keychain and are never exposed in plain text.

## 🩺 Troubleshooting

When encountering issues with the Auth0 MCP Server, several troubleshooting options are available to help diagnose and resolve problems.

Start troubleshooting by exploring all available commands and options:

```bash
npx @auth0/auth0-mcp-server help
```

### 🚥 Operation Modes

#### 🐞 Debug Mode

- More detailed logging
- Enable by setting environment variable: `export DEBUG=auth0-mcp`

> [!TIP]
> Debug mode is particularly useful when troubleshooting connection or authentication issues.

#### 🔑 Scope Selection

The server provides an interactive scope selection interface during initialization:

- **Interactive Selection**: Navigate with arrow keys and toggle selections with spacebar
- **No Default Scopes**: By default, no scopes are selected for maximum security
- **Glob Pattern Support**: Quickly select multiple related scopes with patterns:

  ```bash
  # Select all read scopes
  npx @auth0/auth0-mcp-server init --scopes 'read:*'

  # Select multiple scope patterns (comma-separated)
  npx @auth0/auth0-mcp-server init --scopes 'read:*,create:clients,update:actions'
  ```

> [!NOTE]
> Selected scopes determine what operations the MCP server can perform on your Auth0 tenant.

### ⚙️ Configuration

#### Other MCP Clients:

To use Auth0 MCP Server with any other MCP Client, you can add this configuration to the client and restart for changes to take effect:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "auth0": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@auth0/auth0-mcp-server", "run"],
      "capabilities": ["tools"],
      "env": {
        "DEBUG": "auth0-mcp"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> [!NOTE]  
> You can manually update if needed or if any unexpected errors occur during the npx init command.

### 🚨 Common Issues

1. **Authentication Failures**

   - Ensure you have the correct permissions in your Auth0 tenant
   - Try re-initializing with `npx @auth0/auth0-mcp-server init`

2. **Claude Desktop Can't Connect to the Server**

   - Restart Claude Desktop after installation
   - Check that the server is running with `ps aux | grep auth0-mcp`

3. **API Errors or Permission Issues**

   - Enable debug mode with `export DEBUG=auth0-mcp`
   - Check your Auth0 token status: `npx @auth0/auth0-mcp-server session`
   - Reinitialize with specific scopes: `npx @auth0/auth0-mcp-server init --scopes 'read:*,update:*,create:*'`
   - If a specific operation fails, you may be missing the required scope

4. **Invalid Auth0 Configuration Error**

   - This typically happens when your authorization token is missing or expired
   - Run `npx @auth0/auth0-mcp-server session` to check your token status
   - If expired or missing, run `npx @auth0/auth0-mcp-server init` to authenticate

> [!TIP]
> Most connection issues can be resolved by restarting both the server and Claude Desktop.

## 📋 Debug logs

Enable debug mode to view detailed logs:

```sh
export DEBUG=auth0-mcp
