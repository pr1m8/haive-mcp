# Readonly Filesystem MCP Server

Node.js server implementing Model Context Protocol (MCP) for readonly filesystem operations. A clone from [modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/filesystem).

## Features

- Read files
- List directories
- Search files
- Get file metadata

**Note**: The server will only allow operations within directories specified via `args`.

  - Get detailed file/directory metadata
  - Input: `path` (string)
  - Returns:
    - Size
    - Creation time
    - Modified time
    - Access time
    - Type (file/directory)
    - Permissions

- **list_allowed_directories**

    - Directories that this server can read/write from

## Usage with Claude Desktop

Add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

Note: you can provide sandboxed directories to the server by mounting them to `/projects`. Adding the `ro` flag will make the directory readonly by the server.

### NPX

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@danielsuguimoto/readonly-server-filesystem",
        "/Users/username/Desktop",
        "/path/to/other/allowed/dir"
      ]
