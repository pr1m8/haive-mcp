## Installation

### About UV Installation

For installing alertmcp and managing dependencies, we recommend using the high-speed Python package manager "uv". It's more efficient than pip for creating virtual environments and installing packages.

#### UV Installation Method

You can install uv on Windows (PowerShell) or macOS (bash) with the following command:

```
pip install uv
```

After installation, you can check the version with:

```
uv --version
```

### Installation from GitHub

Clone the repository to your local machine.

#### Using PowerShell (Windows):

```powershell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kousunh/alertmcp.git

# Navigate to the cloned directory
cd alertmcp

# Create a virtual environment
uv venv

# Install the package
uv pip install .
```

#### Using Bash (macOS/Linux):

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kousunh/alertmcp.git

# Navigate to the cloned directory
cd alertmcp

# Create a virtual environment
uv venv

# Install the package
uv pip install .

# For macOS, additionally install pyobjus (in the virtual environment)
uv pip install pyobjus
```

### OS-specific Notes

- **Windows**: The notification function uses `plyer`, which is automatically installed as a dependency.
- **macOS**: The notification function requires `plyer` and `pyobjus`. You need to separately install `pyobjus` even when using uv.

## Setting Up and Using with AI Tools
