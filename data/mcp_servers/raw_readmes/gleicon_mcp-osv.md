# MCP Security Analyst

[![Go](https://github.com/gleicon/mcp-osv/actions/workflows/go.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gleicon/mcp-osv/actions/workflows/go.yml)

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides security analysis capabilities by integrating with OSV.dev and AI models to help identify and analyze potential vulnerabilities in your codebase.

## Features

- Vulnerability checking using OSV.dev database
- Basic security analysis of code files
- Integration with AI models for security insights
- MCP protocol support for seamless integration with various AI tools
- Optional static code analysis using Semgrep (if installed)

## Cursor/Cline and other co-pilots IDE supply-chain preventions

`mcp-osv` is the ideal companion for co-pilot coding. Use the [supply-chain-security-check.mdc] ruleset in this repo or build your own to manage dependencies and reduce risk. See below how to setup your IDE.

## Requirements

### Core Requirements

```bash
make deps
make install
```

### Optional: Semgrep Installation

For enhanced static code analysis, you can install Semgrep:

#### macOS

```bash
brew install semgrep
```

#### Linux

```bash
python3 -m pip install semgrep
```

#### Other platforms

Visit [Semgrep Installation Guide](https://semgrep.dev/docs/getting-started/) for detailed instructions.

The MCP server will work without Semgrep installed, but will skip the static analysis portion when analyzing directories.

## Installation

```bash
make deps
make install
```

The mcp-osv command will be installed on PATH and use the stdin/stdout method.

Configure your LLM to use mcp-osv as an agent.

For **_Cursor_** use the configuration below on `configuration` -> `MCP` tab:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "security_analyst": {
      "name": "Security Analyst",
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "/usr/local/bin/mcp-osv"
    }
  }
}
```

If you are using **_Claude_** just configure it under Settings -> Developer using the config below:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-osv": {
      "command": "/usr/local/bin/mcp-osv",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

1. The server provides the following tools:

### check_vulnerabilities

Check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies using OSV.dev database.

Parameters:

- `package_name`: Name of the package to check
- `version`: Version of the package to check

### analyze_security

Analyze code for potential security issues based on https://osv.dev - a comprehensive database of open-source vulnerabilities.

Parameters:

- `file_path`: Path to the file to analyze

## Integration with AI Models

This server is designed to work with AI models like Claude and Cursor through the MCP protocol. The AI models can use the provided tools to:

1. Check dependencies for known vulnerabilities
2. Analyze code for security issues
3. Provide recommendations for security improvements

## Connecting with Cursor

### Sample output

![output-2](screenshots/mcp-output-2.png)
![output-3](screenshots/mcp-output-3.png)

### Usage

See mcp.json-template for an example that works with Cursor IDE.

After the setup, restart and ask something like "Analyze the security of my project using mcp-osv".

To Debug in VSCode go to Help -> Toggle developer tools and at the console look for mcp.

To test the security analysis capabilities:

```bash
# Check for vulnerabilities in a package
"Check for vulnerabilities in the package 'express' version '4.17.1'"

# Analyze a specific file
"Analyze the security of the file 'main.go'"
```

The server will process your requests and provide security insights through the MCP protocol.

## Connect to Claude

Edit the config file and add the following section (that's the whole file, consider the mcp_osv section if you already have other tools installed.)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp_osv": {
      "command": "/usr/local/bin/mcp-osv",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

## Development

To add new security analysis capabilities:

1. Create a new tool using `mcp.NewTool`
2. Implement the tool handler
3. Add the tool to the server using `s.AddTool`
4. check <https://github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go> for a comprehensive framework to build MCPs in Go.
