## Requirements

- Node.js 16 or higher
- Claude Desktop
- Internet connection to access status APIs

## Installation

### Installing Manually

1. Clone or download this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/imprvhub/mcp-status-observer
cd mcp-status-observer
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Build the project:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Running the MCP Server

There are two ways to run the MCP server:

### Option 1: Running manually

1. Open a terminal or command prompt
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run the server directly:

```bash
node build/index.js
```

Keep this terminal window open while using Claude Desktop. The server will run until you close the terminal.

### Option 2: Auto-starting with Claude Desktop (recommended for regular use)

The Claude Desktop can automatically start the MCP server when needed. To set this up:

#### Configuration

The Claude Desktop configuration file is located at:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

Edit this file to add the Status Observer MCP configuration. If the file doesn't exist, create it:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "statusObserver": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_DIRECTORY/mcp-status-observer/build/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Important**: Replace `ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_DIRECTORY` with the **complete absolute path** where you installed the MCP

- macOS/Linux example: `/Users/username/mcp-status-observer`
- Windows example: `C:\\Users\\username\\mcp-status-observer`

If you already have other MCPs configured, simply add the "statusObserver" section inside the "mcpServers" object. Here's an example of a configuration with multiple MCPs:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "otherMcp1": {
      "command": "...",
      "args": ["..."]
    },
    "otherMcp2": {
      "command": "...",
      "args": ["..."]
    },
    "statusObserver": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_DIRECTORY/mcp-status-observer/build/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

The MCP server will automatically start when Claude Desktop needs it, based on the configuration in your `claude_desktop_config.json` file.

## Usage

1. Restart Claude Desktop after modifying the configuration
2. In Claude, use the `status` command to interact with the Status Observer MCP Server
3. The MCP server runs as a subprocess managed by Claude Desktop

## Available Commands

The Status Observer MCP provides a single tool named `status` with several commands:

| Command        | Description                        | Parameters    | Example           |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| `list`         | List all available platforms       | None          | `status list`     |
| `--[platform]` | Get status for a specific platform | Platform name | `status --github` |
| `--all`        | Get status for all platforms       | None          | `status --all`    |

## Example Usage

Here are various examples of how to use the Status Observer with Claude:

### Direct Commands:

```
status --all
status --amplitude
status --anthropic
status --asana
status --atlassian
status --cloudflare
status --digitalocean
status --discord
status --docker
status --dropbox
status --gcp
status --gemini
status --github
status --linkedin
status --netlify
status --npm
status --openai
status --reddit
status --slack
status --twilio
status --vercel
status --x
status list
```

### Preview

### Natural Language Prompts:

You can also interact with the MCP using natural language. Claude will interpret these requests and use the appropriate commands:

- "Could you check if there are any issues with Google Cloud Platform services right now?"
- "Has there been any recent issues with Claude or the Anthropic API?"
- "Is OpenAI experiencing any outages at the moment?"
- "What's the current status of LinkedIn?"
- "Pull Requests are down? What's the status of GitHub?"
- "Can you tell me if Google's Gemini AI is experiencing any service disruptions or outages right now?"
- "Check if Docker Hub Automated Builds is experiencing any outages"
- "Show me the status of all major platforms"

## Troubleshooting

### "Server disconnected" error

If you see the error "MCP Status Observer: Server disconnected" in Claude Desktop:

1. **Verify the server is running**:

   - Open a terminal and manually run `node build/index.js` from the project directory
   - If the server starts successfully, use Claude while keeping this terminal open

2. **Check your configuration**:
   - Ensure the absolute path in `claude_desktop_config.json` is correct for your system
   - Double-check that you've used double backslashes (`\\`) for Windows paths
   - Verify you're using the complete path from the root of your filesystem

### Tools not appearing in Claude

If the Status Observer tools don't appear in Claude:

- Make sure you've restarted Claude Desktop after configuration
- Check the Claude Desktop logs for any MCP communication errors
- Ensure the MCP server process is running (run it manually to confirm)
- Verify that the MCP server is correctly registered in the Claude Desktop MCP registry

### Checking if the server is running

To check if the server is running:

- **Windows**: Open Task Manager, go to the "Details" tab, and look for "node.exe"
- **macOS/Linux**: Open Terminal and run `ps aux | grep node`

If you don't see the server running, start it manually or use the auto-start method.

## Contributing

### Adding New Status APIs

Contributors can easily add support for additional platforms by modifying the `initializePlatforms` method in `src/index.ts`. The process is straightforward:

1. Identify a platform's status API endpoint
2. Add a new entry using the `addPlatform` method with the following parameters:
   - `id`: A unique identifier for the platform (lowercase, no spaces)
   - `name`: The display name of the platform
   - `url`: The status API endpoint URL
   - `description`: A brief description of the platform

Example:

```typescript
this.addPlatform(
  "newservice",
  "New Service",
  "https://status.newservice.com/api/v2/summary.json",
  "Description of the service",
);
```

Different status APIs may return data in different formats. If a new platform's API returns data in a format that isn't handled by the existing code, you might need to add specific parsing logic for that platform.
