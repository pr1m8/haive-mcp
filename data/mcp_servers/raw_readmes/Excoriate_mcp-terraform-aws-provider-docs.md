## Overview

This server acts as an MCP server, exposing tools and resources that allow AI
agents or other MCP clients to query information about
[Terraform AWS Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest)
information, such as:

- ✅ Resources documentation.
- ✅ Provider's configuration, including ephemeral resources, guides, and
  functions.
- ✅ GitHub Issues (opened, closed, and all)
- ✅ AWS Resources examples

### What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and how does it work?

> The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that enables seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources and tools. Whether you're building an AI-powered IDE, enhancing a chat interface, or creating custom AI workflows, MCP provides a standardized way to connect LLMs with the context they need.

### Why?

When writing IaC, or designing
[terraform modules](https://www.terraform.io/language/modules), it's often
required a very good knowledge, understanding and context in the actual AWS
resources, features, and capabilities in order to design a production-grade
module, with stable interfaces, composable, and reusable.

This MCP server is designed to provide just that, with the latest documentation,
issues, and examples from the
[Terraform AWS Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest)
registry site. Always up-to-date, and always from the source.

## Tools

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All tools require a valid GitHub token set as an environment variable:
> `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN`, or `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`.

Currently, the following tools are available (more to come, or feel free to
submit an
[issue](https://github.com/Excoriate/mcp-terraform-aws-provider/issues) or
[PR](https://github.com/Excoriate/mcp-terraform-aws-provider/pulls)):

## Getting Started

### Install and Use with Claude Desktop

To use this Deno-based MCP server with Claude Desktop, add the following to your
`claude_desktop_config.json`:

#### Using Deno

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tf_aws_provider_docs": {
      "command": "deno",
      "args": ["run", "-A", "main.ts"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_TOKEN": "<YOUR_TOKEN>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Or, the recommended way, with deno directly from [JSR](https://jsr.io/)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tf_aws_provider_docs": {
      "command": "deno",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-A",
        "jsr:@excoriate/mcp-terraform-aws-provider-docs@0.1.0"
      ],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_TOKEN": "<YOUR_TOKEN>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Using Docker

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tf_aws_provider_docs": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-e",
        "GITHUB_TOKEN=<YOUR_TOKEN>",
        "mcp-terraform-aws-provider-docs"
      ],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_TOKEN": "<YOUR_TOKEN>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Installing in IDE/Editor(s)o

#### Install on Cursor

Go to: `Settings` -> `Cursor Settings` -> `MCP` -> `Add new global MCP server`

Pasting the following configuration into your Cursor `~/.cursor/mcp.json` file
is the recommended approach. See
[Cursor MCP docs](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol) for
more info.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tf_aws_provider_docs": {
      "command": "deno",
      "args": ["-A", "jsr:@excoriate/mcp-terraform-aws-provider-docs@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Install on Windsurf

Add this to your Windsurf MCP config file. See
[Windsurf MCP docs](https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/mcp) for more info.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tf_aws_provider_docs": {
      "command": "deno",
      "args": ["-A", "jsr:@excoriate/mcp-terraform-aws-provider-docs@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Install on VSCode

Add this to your VSCode MCP config file. See
[VSCode MCP docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers)
for more info.

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "Context7": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "deno",
      "args": ["-A", "jsr:@excoriate/mcp-terraform-aws-provider-docs@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Developing & Contributing

For more details about debugging, testing, and contributing to this project,
see [DEVELOPER_GUIDE](DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md), and [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Run it directly from JSR

You can use the MCP server directly from [JSR](https://jsr.io/) (Javascript
Registry ❤️)

```sh
# export your github token
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxx...

# run it
deno run -A jsr:@excoriate/mcp-terraform-aws-provider-docs@latest
```

### Debugging & Troubleshooting

if you want to debug it, use the built-in debugger
([inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector)). There's a
justfile recipe to help you out.

```sh
# start the mcp server, and the inspector
just inspect
```

### Using Docker

Build the Docker image

```sh
docker build -t mcp-terraform-aws-provider-docs .
```

Run the MCP server in Docker

```sh
docker run -it --rm \
  -e GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxx... \
  mcp-terraform-aws-provider-docs
```

> [!TIP]
> Replace `ghp_xxx...` with your
> [GitHub Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)
> with appropriate permissions.
>
> You can also use `GH_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` as the
> environment variable name.
>
> If you want to use a local `.env` file, you can pass it with
> `--env-file .env`.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add tool to retrieve provider's configuration.
- [ ] Integrated with dedicated backend, to index, and provide advance search/code assistant documentation avoiding GitHub API rate limits.
