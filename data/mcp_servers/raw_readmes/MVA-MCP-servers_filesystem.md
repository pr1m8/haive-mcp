# Filesystem MCP Server

Node.js server implementing Model Context Protocol (MCP) for filesystem operations.

## Features

- Advanced file operations:
  - Standard read/write with size limits
  - Streaming reads with position control
  - Smart append with duplication prevention
  - Automatic write optimization
- Directory operations:
  - Create/list/navigate directories
  - Recursive directory tree view
  - Depth-limited traversal
- File management:
  - Move files/directories
  - Search with pattern matching
  - Get detailed file metadata

**Note**: The server will only allow operations within directories specified via `args`.

## API

### Resources

- `file://system`: File system operations interface

### Advanced Features

#### Reading Strategy Selection

Choose the appropriate reading method based on your needs:

- Use `read_file` for small files (<1MB) to get complete content
- Use `stream_read_file` for:
  - Large files that exceed memory limits
  - When you need only a specific portion of a file
  - Reading from the end of files (logs, databases)
  - Processing files in manageable chunks

#### Negative Offset Reading

The `stream_read_file` tool supports negative offset values, allowing you to read from the end of files:

- Offset `-N` means "start reading N bytes from the end of file"
- Perfect for reading the most recent entries in log files
- System automatically calculates the correct position in the file
- If the absolute value of negative offset exceeds file size, reading starts from the beginning

#### Write Optimization

The server automatically optimizes file writing operations based on:

- Content size (large content uses smart_append)
- File size (large files use smart_append)
- File existence (new vs existing files)
- Write intent (full vs partial overwrite)

#### Content Completion Marker

Content can include completion markers ("// END_OF_CONTENT") to indicate complete writes.
This helps the system automatically detect and handle incomplete content during writes.

### Tools

- **read_file**

  - Read complete contents of a file
  - Input: `path` (string)
  - Reads complete file contents with UTF-8 encoding
  - For files larger than 1MB, only the first 1MB is returned with a warning
  - Best for smaller files where you need the complete content

- **stream_read_file**

  - Read large files with precise control over reading positions
  - Perfect for:
    - Processing large files in manageable chunks
    - Extracting specific portions without loading entire file
    - Reading from the end of files (like logs)
    - Reading files too large for standard read_file
  - Inputs:
    - `path` (string): File to read
    - `offset` (number, optional): Starting position in bytes (default: 0)
      - Can be negative to read from end of file (e.g., -1000 reads last 1000 bytes)
      - If abs(offset) exceeds file size, reads from beginning
    - `limit` (number, optional): Maximum bytes to read
    - `encoding` (string, optional): Character encoding (default: 'utf8')
    - `chunkSize` (number, optional): Size of chunks for streaming (default: 512KB)
  - Returns selected portion of the file with info about read size and position
  - Examples:
    - Read last 1000 bytes: `offset: -1000`
    - Read specific section: `offset: 5000, limit: 2000`
    - Read from end with limit: `offset: -5000, limit: 1000` (1000 bytes starting 5000 bytes from end)

- **read_multiple_files**

  - Read multiple files simultaneously
  - Inputs:
    - `paths` (string[]): Array of file paths
    - `logLevel` (string, optional): Debug level ('debug', 'info', 'warn', 'error')
  - Failed reads won't stop the entire operation
  - For files larger than 1MB, only first 1MB is returned

- **write_file**

  - Create new file or overwrite existing (exercise caution with this)
  - Inputs:
    - `path` (string): File location
    - `content` (string): File content
  - With optimization enabled, may automatically select optimal write method
  - Complete overwrite of existing files

- **append_file**

  - Append content to the end of a file (or create if doesn't exist)
  - Inputs:
    - `path` (string): File location
    - `content` (string): Content to append
  - Safer than write_file when you want to preserve existing content
  - With optimization enabled, may use smart_append for large content

- **smart_append_file**

  - Intelligently append content without duplication
  - Inputs:
    - `path` (string): File location
    - `content` (string): Content to append
    - `chunkSize` (number, optional): Initial buffer size for overlap detection (default: 1024)
    - `logLevel` (string, optional): Debug level ('debug', 'info', 'warn', 'error')
  - Features:
    - Detects overlapping content between file end and new content beginning
    - Only appends non-overlapping content to avoid duplication
    - Uses dynamic buffer sizing for reliable overlap detection
    - Employs optimized algorithms (Rabin-Karp for large chunks)
  - Perfect for:
    - Resilient logging where writes may be interrupted
    - Incremental data collection
    - Ensuring content integrity during appends

- **edit_file**

  - Make selective edits using advanced pattern matching and formatting
  - Features:
    - Line-based and multi-line content matching
    - Whitespace normalization with indentation preservation
    - Multiple simultaneous edits with correct positioning
    - Indentation style detection and preservation
    - Git-style diff output with context
    - Preview changes with dry run mode
  - Inputs:
    - `path` (string): File to edit
    - `edits` (array): List of edit operations
      - `oldText` (string): Text to search for (can be substring)
      - `newText` (string): Text to replace with
    - `dryRun` (boolean): Preview changes without applying (default: false)
  - Returns detailed diff and match information for dry runs, otherwise applies changes
  - Best Practice: Always use dryRun first to preview changes before applying them

- **create_directory**

  - Create new directory or ensure it exists
  - Input: `path` (string)
  - Creates parent directories if needed
  - Succeeds silently if directory exists

- **list_directory**

  - List directory contents with [FILE] or [DIR] prefixes

- **move_file**

  - Move or rename files and directories
  - Inputs:
    - `source` (string)
    - `destination` (string)
  - Fails if destination exists

- **search_files**

  - Recursively search for files/directories
  - Inputs:
    - `path` (string): Starting directory
    - `pattern` (string): Search pattern
    - `excludePatterns` (string[]): Exclude any patterns. Glob formats are supported.

  - Returns structured JSON with type, name, and children properties
  - Files have no children array, directories always have children array

- **get_file_info**

  - Get detailed file/directory metadata
  - Input: `path` (string)
  - Returns:
    - Size
    - Creation time
    - Modified time
    - Access time
    - Type (file/directory)
    - Permissions

- **list_allowed_directories**
  - List all directories the server is allowed to access
  - No input required
  - Returns:
    - Directories that this server can read/write from

## Usage with Claude Desktop

Add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

Note: you can provide sandboxed directories to the server by mounting them to `/projects`. Adding the `ro` flag will make the directory readonly by the server.

### Docker

Note: all directories must be mounted to `/projects` by default.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "--mount",
        "type=bind,src=/Users/username/Desktop,dst=/projects/Desktop",
        "--mount",
        "type=bind,src=/path/to/other/allowed/dir,dst=/projects/other/allowed/dir,ro",
        "--mount",
        "type=bind,src=/path/to/file.txt,dst=/projects/path/to/file.txt",
        "mcp/filesystem",
        "/projects"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### NPX

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
        "/Users/username/Desktop",
        "/path/to/other/allowed/dir"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
