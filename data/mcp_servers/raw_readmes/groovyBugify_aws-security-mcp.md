## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **uv** (Python package manager) - [Installation Guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#installation-methods)
- **Python 3.11+**
- **AWS Account** with proper credentials
- **MCP Client** (Claude Desktop, Cline, 5ire, etc.)

## Cross-Account Access Setup

### How Cross-Account Access Works

AWS Security MCP automatically discovers and accesses multiple AWS accounts using a smart approach:

1. **Organization Discovery**: First, it attempts to list accounts using `aws organizations list-accounts`
2. **Role Assumption**: For each discovered account, it tries to assume the IAM role: `aws-security-mcp-cross-account-access`
3. **Fallback**: If an account is not part of an AWS Organization, it defaults to standard AWS credential resolution (profile/environment/IMDS/ECS)

### Setting Up Cross-Account Access

For each AWS account you want to access, create an IAM role with these specifications:

**Role Name:** `aws-security-mcp-cross-account-access`

**Trust Policy:**

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::YOUR-MASTER-ACCOUNT-ID:root"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Attached Policy:** `SecurityAudit` (AWS Managed Policy)

This setup allows the MCP server to securely access resources across all your AWS accounts with read-only security permissions.

## MCP Client Setup (Step-by-Step)

### Primary Method: Server-Sent Events (SSE) - Recommended

**This is the primary and recommended way to run AWS Security MCP.** SSE provides better performance, stability, and compatibility with various MCP clients.

1. **Configure your AWS Credentials**:

   AWS Security MCP automatically detects and uses AWS credentials from your ~/.aws/credentials, AWS_PROFILE, env variables or metadata endpoints.

   **Required IAM Permissions**: Your default AWS profile/credentials must have the following permissions:

   1. **Cross-Account Role Assumption Policy:**

   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Sid": "CrossAccountAccess",
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": ["sts:AssumeRole"],
         "Resource": [
           "arn:aws:iam::*:role/aws-security-mcp-cross-account-access"
         ]
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

   2. **Organization Discovery Policy:**

   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Sid": "OrganizationAccess",
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": ["organizations:ListAccounts"],
         "Resource": "*"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

   3. **AWS SecurityAudit Managed Policy** (attach to your user/role):

   ```
   arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/SecurityAudit
   ```

   **Important**: These permissions allow the default profile to discover organization accounts, assume cross-account roles, and perform security audits across your AWS infrastructure.

   **Security Note**: At no point can the MCP Client retrieve AWS credentials. All credential handling is done securely by the MCP server, and only API responses are shared with the client.

   **Cross-Account Access**: The system automatically discovers AWS Organization accounts and assumes the `aws-security-mcp-cross-account-access` role where available.

2. **Start the SSE Server locally:**

   ```bash
   # Navigate to the aws-security-mcp directory
   cd /path/to/aws-security-mcp

   # Start the SSE server
   python aws_security_mcp/main.py sse
   ```

3. **Configure Your MCP Client:**

   **For Claude Desktop with SSE:**

   First, install the mcp-proxy tool:

   ```bash
   # Install mcp-proxy using uv
   uv tool install mcp-proxy

   # Find the absolute path of mcp-proxy (you'll need this for the config)
   which mcp-proxy
   # Example output: /Users/username/.local/bin/mcp-proxy
   ```

   Then configure Claude Desktop:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "aws-security": {
         "command": "/Users/username/.local/bin/mcp-proxy",
         "args": ["http://localhost:8000/sse"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   **Important:** Replace `/Users/username/.local/bin/mcp-proxy` with the actual path from the `which mcp-proxy` command above.

   **For Other MCP Clients:**

   - Connect to: `http://localhost:8000/sse`
   - Use Server-Sent Events transport
   - Health check: `http://localhost:8000/health`

### Alternative Method: stdio (Claude Desktop Legacy)

**Note:** This method is kept for backward compatibility but SSE is recommended.

1. **Configure Claude Desktop with stdio:**

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "aws-security": {
         "command": "/full/path/to/aws-security-mcp/run_aws_security.sh",
         "args": ["stdio"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Direct File Edit Locations:**

   - **macOS:** `/Users/YOUR_USER/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
   - **Linux:** `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

3. **Restart Claude Desktop** to load the new configuration

## Advanced SSE Usage

### Testing and Development

1. **Test with MCP Inspector:**

   ```bash
   # Use the MCP Inspector to test the connection:
   npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector http://127.0.0.1:8000/sse
   ```

2. **Direct SSE Testing:**

   ```bash
   # Test the SSE endpoint directly:
   curl -N -H "Accept: text/event-stream" http://localhost:8000/sse
   ```

3. **Health Check:**
   ```bash
   # Check server health:
   curl http://localhost:8000/health
   ```

### Production Deployment

1. **Docker Deployment:**

   ```bash
   # Build the container:
   docker build -t aws-security-mcp .

   # Run with environment variables:
   docker run -p 8000:8000 \
     -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_key \
     -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret \
     -e AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1 \
     aws-security-mcp
   ```

2. **Environment Variables for SSE:**
   ```bash
   # Optional SSE configuration
   export MCP_HOST=0.0.0.0          # Bind to all interfaces
   export MCP_PORT=8000             # Server port
   export MCP_LOG_LEVEL=info        # Logging level
   export MCP_DEBUG=false           # Debug mode
   ```

### Load Balancer Configuration

When deploying behind a load balancer:

- **Health Check Path:** `/health`
- **SSE Endpoint:** `/sse`
- **Important:** Configure your load balancer to NOT redirect `/sse` to `/sse/`
- **Sticky Sessions:** Not required (stateless design)
- **Timeout:** Set appropriate timeouts for SSE connections (recommended: 30+ seconds)

### Benefits of SSE over stdio

- **Better Performance:** Reduced overhead and better resource management
- **Scalability:** Multiple clients can connect to the same server
- **Monitoring:** Built-in health checks and observability
- **Cloud Native:** Works seamlessly in containerized environments
- **Flexibility:** Compatible with various MCP clients and custom integrations

## Sample Queries and Usage

### Cross-Account Queries

**Query:** "Can you share connected AWS accounts?"

**Response:** The MCP tool will return a list of all AWS accounts in your organization that the server can access, including account IDs, names, and status.

**Query:** "Can you refresh my AWS session?"

**Response:** The MCP tool refreshes all valid boto3 sessions across multiple AWS accounts, ensuring you have the latest credentials and permissions.

### Infrastructure Queries

**Query:** "Show me all EC2 instances across all accounts"

**Query:** "Find security groups with port 22 open to the internet"

**Query:** "List S3 buckets with public read access"

**Query:** "Show me GuardDuty findings from the last 7 days"

**Query:** "Generate a network map for my production environment"

**Query:** "What's the blast radius if the web-tier security group is compromised?"

## Performance Optimization

### Streamlined Tool Architecture

AWS Security MCP has been optimized from **110+ individual tools** to **38 core tools** with nested functionality. This provides several benefits:

- **Reduced Memory Usage**: Prevents server memory errors in resource-constrained environments
- **Faster Loading**: Quicker startup and tool discovery
- **Better Organization**: Related functions are grouped logically
- **Improved Reliability**: Fewer tools mean less complexity and fewer failure points

### Tool Categories

The 38 tools are organized into these categories:

- **Account Management** (3 tools): Cross-account access, session management
- **IAM Security** (5 tools): Roles, policies, users, access analysis
- **Compute Security** (8 tools): EC2, Lambda, containers
- **Network Security** (6 tools): VPCs, security groups, load balancers
- **Storage Security** (4 tools): S3, EBS, file systems
- **Security Services** (8 tools): GuardDuty, SecurityHub, WAF, Shield
- **Compliance & Audit** (4 tools): Config, CloudTrail, Access Analyzer

Each tool can handle multiple related operations, providing the same functionality as the original 110+ tools but with better performance.

  "mcpServers": {
    "aws-security": {
      "command": "/Users/username/.local/bin/mcp-proxy",
      "args": ["http://localhost:8000/sse"]
    },
    "shodan": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@mcp/shodan"],
      "env": {
        "SHODAN_API_KEY": "your-shodan-key"
      }
    },
    "brave-search": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@mcp/brave-search"],
      "env": {
        "BRAVE_API_KEY": "your-brave-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No tools available" or empty tool list:**

   - Check AWS credentials are properly configured
   - Verify the `run_aws_security.sh` script is executable
   - Ensure you're using Claude Pro (free version has token limitations)

2. **Cross-account access not working:**

   - Verify the `aws-security-mcp-cross-account-access` role exists in target accounts
   - Check the trust policy allows your master account
   - Ensure the SecurityAudit policy is attached

3. **MCP server crashes or memory errors:**

   - This should be resolved with the new 38-tool architecture
   - If issues persist, check system resources and Python memory limits

4. **Slow response times:**
   - Large AWS environments may take time to query
   - Consider using more specific queries to reduce scope
   - Check AWS API rate limits in CloudTrail

### Debugging

**MCP Server Logs:**

- **macOS:** `/Users/{userName}/Library/Logs/Claude`
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\Logs`
- **Linux:** `~/.local/share/Claude/Logs`

**Enable Debug Mode:**

```bash
# Add to run_aws_security.sh
export MCP_DEBUG=true
export AWS_SDK_DEBUG=true
```

**Test MCP Server Directly:**

```bash
# Test the server without Claude
python -m aws_security_mcp.server --transport stdio
```

## Security Considerations

- **Least Privilege**: The SecurityAudit policy provides read-only access
- **Credential Management**: Use IAM roles instead of access keys when possible
- **Network Security**: Consider running in private subnets for production use
- **Audit Logging**: All AWS API calls are logged in CloudTrail
- **Session Management**: Sessions are automatically refreshed and expire safely

## System Requirements

- **Memory**: Minimum 2GB RAM (4GB recommended for large AWS environments)
- **Python**: Version 3.11 or higher
- **Network**: Internet access for AWS API calls
- **Disk Space**: ~100MB for installation and logs
