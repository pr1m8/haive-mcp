1. Run Cutter
2. Go to **Edit -> Preferences -> Plugins**
3. Find the plugin directory location
4. Copy `CutterMCPPlugin.py` from the downloaded release and paste it inside the **python** folder
5. Restart Cutter

## MCP Clients

Theoretically, any MCP client should work with cutterMCP. one example is given below.

## Example 1: Claude Desktop

To set up Claude Desktop as a Cutter MCP client, go to `Claude` -> `Settings` -> `Developer` -> `Edit Config` -> `claude_desktop_config.json` and add the following:

MacOS/Linux :

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cutter": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["/ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO/bridge_mcp_cutter.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

Windows :

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cutter": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["C:\\ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO\\bridge_mcp_cutter.py"]
    }
  }
}
```
