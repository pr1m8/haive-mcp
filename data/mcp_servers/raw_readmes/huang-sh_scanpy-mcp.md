# Scanpy MCP server

An MCP server for scRNA-Seq analysis software Scanpy with natural language!

## 🪩 What can it do?

- IO module like read and write scRNA-Seq data with natural language
- Preprocessing module,like filtering, quality control, normalization, scaling, highly-variable genes, PCA, Neighbors,...
- Tool module, like clustering, differential expression etc.
- Plotting module, like violin, heatmap, dotplot

## ❓ Who is this for?

- Anyone who wants to do scRNA-Seq analysis natural language!
- Agent developers who want to call scanpy's functions for their applications

## 🌐 Where to use it?

You can use scanpy-mcp in most AI clients, plugins, or agent frameworks that support the MCP:

- AI clients, like Cherry Studio
- Plugins, like Cline
- Agent frameworks, like Agno
