      "args": ["@container-inc/mcp"],
    },
  },
}
```

2. Check the editor's settings to ensure it is enabled.
3. Just ask to deploy to Container Inc.

## Notes

- You'll be asked to login with GitHub this is so that:
  1. We can create a repository if needed
  2. Publish the docker image to ghcr.io
  3. Pull the code in the builder
- Ensure your project has a `Dockerfile` so it can be built
