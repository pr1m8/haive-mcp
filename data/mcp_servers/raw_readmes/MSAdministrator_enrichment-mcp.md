# Enrichment MCP Server

This project is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for performing enrichment given a provided observable. The combination of configured services and the provided observable(s) will determine which enrichment services to call.

This tool provides a simple MCP server implementation to perform third-party enrichment using common services (e.g. VirusTotal, Hybrid Analysis, etc.) utilizing the [security-cli](https://github.com/MSAdministrator/security-cli) python package to perform enrichment/communicate with different services.

## MCP Server

This implementation of the `enrichment-mcp` MCP server exposes the following [tools](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools).

- lookup-observable - A generic endpoint which examines and routes the given observable to the correct tool.

## Supported Services

The following services and observable types are currently supported:

## Requirements

This MCP service uses `security-cli` and a custom [config.yaml.example](./config.yaml.example) file to determine which third-party enrichment services are supported for observable lookups.

The easiest way to run this on a local mac/system is:

```bash
uv run --env-file .env server.py
```

This requires that you use the provided template [.env.example](.env.example) and create a new `.env` file with your secrets.

> NOTE: Please review the documentation for [security-cli](https://github.com/MSAdministrator/security-cli) for information on configuring different services.
> The default will suffice for most use cases.

### Environmental Variables

> NOTE: It is highly recommended to set secrets as environmental variables when implementing this service. Stop storing secrets silly goose.

In order for the `security-cli` package to discover these variables, they must be in a specific format. Below is the list of currently supported variables:

- ENRICHMENT_MCP_VIRUSTOTAL_KEY
- ENRICHMENT_MCP_HYBRIDANALYSIS_KEY
- ENRICHMENT_MCP_ALIENVAULT_KEY
- ENRICHMENT_MCP_SHODAN_KEY
- ENRICHMENT_MCP_URLSCAN_KEY
- ENRICHMENT_MCP_ABUSEIPDB_KEY
- ENRICHMENT_MCP_HIBP_KEY

### Enrichments Configuration

Each enrichment service is defined in the `securiy-cli` config file. Additionally, I have broken out the different types of enrichment that can be performed. This means, in the current implementation, we have a single action type called `enrich` but in the future this can be expanded for things like `scans` or `queries` etc.

Underneath these high-level actions, we list out the observable type followed by a list of services that support that type. The currently supported observable types are:

- ipaddress - ipv4 addresses
- domain - A domain or netloc
- url - A fully qualified URL with schema, etc.
- email - A standard email address

We also support these types but they are currently not implemented:

- md5 - A file MD5 hash
- sha1 - A file SHA1 hash
- sha256 - A file SHA256 hash

Each service must have a `name` and a `template`. The `apikey` field can be provided but we recommend to use environmental variables.

### Prompt Templates

Each service and observable type can have it's own response template. These reside in the `security-cli` [templates](./templates/) directory and all templates are expected to exist here.

Each service defined has a prompt template using jinja2 templates. You can modify these are needed, but the format of the filename must remain the same.

These files have the following filename pattern.

```bash
{service.name}.{enrichment.type}.jinja2
```

> Ensure that the response object has the correct fields in the template itself or you will receive an error.

Below is an example output for a prompt of `Enrich this IP 91.195.240.94` with some errors mixed in:

## MCP Server Usage

For using a pre-built server, instructions from here: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user

- Download Claude for Desktop
- Install uv

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

- Download this repo and add to Claude for Desktop config
  - Claude for Desktop > Settings > Developer > Edit Config

> You can copy the provided [.desktop_config.example.json](.desktop_config.example.json) file

If you want to create it yourself, these are the paths for Claude Desktop.

```bash
macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
Windows: %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
```

Open up the configuration file in any text editor. Replace the file contents with this:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "enrichment-mcp": {
      "command": "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER/uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/CLONED/REPOSITORY/enrichment-mcp",
        "run",
        "server.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

4. Relaunch Claude for Desktop

You should now see two icons in the chat bar, a hammer which shows the tools available and a connection icon which shows the prompt defined and the input required.
