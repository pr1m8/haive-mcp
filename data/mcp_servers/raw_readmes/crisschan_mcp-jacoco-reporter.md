# MCP-JaCoCo

MCP-JaCoCo is a server tool that converts JaCoCo code coverage reports into formats optimized for Large Language Models (LLMs), making AI-driven analysis easier and more effective.

# Why It Matters

As AI and LLMs play a bigger role in software development, traditional code coverage reports—like those from JaCoCo—need a makeover. While great for humans, their XML format isn’t ideal for AI tools to process or analyze. MCP-JaCoCo bridges this gap by transforming these reports into LLM-friendly formats, unlocking powerful benefits for development teams:

- Quick, meaningful summaries of code coverage
- Easy identification of untested or poorly tested code
- Smart suggestions for new test cases
- Streamlined AI-assisted test planning
- Automated documentation of coverage results
  With MCP-JaCoCo, teams can tap into AI’s full potential, boosting efficiency and insight in testing workflows.

# What It Solves

- **Complex Formats**: Simplifies JaCoCo’s dense XML reports for AI use
- **Scattered Data**: Pulls coverage metrics into one accessible place
- **Slow Analysis**: Cuts down on time-consuming manual reviews
- **Integration Hurdles**: Makes raw data play nicely with AI tools

# Key Features

- **Smart Conversion**: Transforms JaCoCo XML reports into LLM-friendly JSON format
- **Flexible Coverage Types**: Supports multiple coverage metrics (instruction, branch, line, etc.)
- **Efficient Processing**: Fast and lightweight report processing
- **Structured Output**: Well-organized JSON format for easy AI consumption
- **Customizable Analysis**: Filter coverage data by specific metrics of interest

# Installation

Install MCP-JaCoCo using uv with this configuration:

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
     "mcp-jacoco-reporter-server": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--with",
        "mcp[cli]",
        "mcp",
        "run",
        "/Users/crisschan/workspace/pyspace/mcp-jacoco-reporter/mcp-jacoco-reporter-server.py"
      ],
      "env": {
        "COVERED_TYPES": "nocovered, partiallycovered, fullcovered"
      },
      "alwaysAllow": [
        "jacoco_reporter_server"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

# Tool

## jacoco_reporter_server

- Reads JaCoCo XML report and returns coverage data in JSON format
- Input:
  - jacoco_xmlreport_path: Path to JaCoCo xml report path(jacoco.xml)
- Return:
  - String, formatted JSON data containing coverage metrics

Example output format:

```json
