### Integration with Claude

To use this MCP server with Claude, you need to add it to the MCP settings file:

1. For Claude VSCode extension, add it to `c:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\globalStorage\saoudrizwan.claude-dev\settings\cline_mcp_settings.json`
2. For Claude desktop app, add it to `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` on Windows

Example configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "smartlead": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["E:/mcp-servers/smartlead/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {

      },
