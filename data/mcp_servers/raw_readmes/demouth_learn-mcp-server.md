# learn-mcp-server

This repository provides a simple MCP (Model Context Protocol) server implementation for educational purposes.
The server supports basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), and this README describes how to use it from Claude Desktop.

## step 1

Build source code from this repository.

```sh
$ go build ./
```

## step 2

In the Claude for Desktop App configuration file, include the following:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "calculator": {
      "command": "/path/to/github.com/demouth/learn-mcp-server/learn-mcp-server",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

see https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/server

## step 3

Restart Claude for Desktop.

## step 4

Ask the following question in Claude for Desktop:

```
What is the answer to the following formula?
1234 x 56789
```

Logs are output to the following directory:

```
~/Library/Logs/Claude/
```

The following log will be output:

```
2025-04-08T15:08:36.443Z [calculator] [info] Message from client: {"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"calculate","arguments":{"operation":"multiply","x":1234,"y":56789}},"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":35}
2025-04-08T15:08:36.443Z [calculator] [info] Message from server: {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":35,"result":{"content":[{"type":"text","text":"70077626.00"}]}}
```
