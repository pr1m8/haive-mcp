# Filesystem MCP Server

Node.js server implementing Model Context Protocol (MCP) for filesystem operations.

## Features

- Read/create/append multiple files
- Create/list/delete directories and files
- Copy/move files and directories
- Search files by name, glob pattern, or content regex
- Patch files using line numbers
- File and content diffing
- Count lines in files
- Generate and verify file checksums
- Get file metadata and directory trees

**Note**: The server will only allow operations within directories specified via `args`.

## Code Structure

The codebase follows a feature-based organization where each API operation has its own directory:

```

```

Each operation directory typically contains:

- `schema.ts` - Zod schema for input validation
- `handler.ts` - Main handler function for the operation
- `helpers.ts` - Helper functions (where needed)

## Usage with Claude Desktop

Add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

Note: you can provide sandboxed directories to the server by mounting them to `/projects`. Adding the `ro` flag will make the directory readonly by the server.

### Docker

Note: all directories must be mounted to `/projects` by default.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "--mount",
        "type=bind,src=/Users/username/Desktop,dst=/projects/Desktop",
        "--mount",
        "type=bind,src=/path/to/other/allowed/dir,dst=/projects/other/allowed/dir,ro",
        "--mount",
        "type=bind,src=/path/to/file.txt,dst=/projects/path/to/file.txt",
        "mcp/filesystem",
        "/projects"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### NPX

### Windows

#### Local

```json
"filesystem-extended": {
    "command": "node",
    "args": ["C:\\Projects\\mcp\\server\\system\\files\\mcp-filesystem-extended\\dist\\index.js", "C:\\Projects", "C:\\git", "C:\\git\\privadent\\privadent-synchronizer"]
}
```
