### Fastly's API-First Approach

Fastly's API-first design philosophy means:

- **Everything is an API** - Every feature available in the Fastly UI is accessible via API
- **Programmatic Control** - Full control over services, configurations, and edge logic
- **Automation Ready** - Support for CI/CD workflows and infrastructure as code
- **Real-time Changes** - API changes propagate globally in seconds, not minutes or hours

## What Can I Do With Fastly API?

Fastly's [comprehensive API](https://www.fastly.com/documentation/reference/api/) allows you to:

- **Manage CDN Services** - Create, configure, and deploy content delivery services
- **Control Caching** - Set up cache strategies and perform instant purges
- **Configure Security** - Manage WAF, DDoS protection, and TLS certificates
- **Monitor Performance** - Access real-time metrics and historical stats
- **Implement Edge Logic** - Deploy custom VCL or Compute@Edge applications
- **Automate Workflows** - Integrate with CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure tools

### Your API Key Stays Safe!

The AI assistant never sees your Fastly API key. It talks to a local helper (FastlyMCP) which uses the key securely.

### What You Can Ask Your AI

With Fastly MCP configured, you can ask your AI assistant questions like:

| What You Want To Do | Example AI Request                                                |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| List your services  | "Show me all my Fastly services"                                  |
| Get domain details  | "What domains are configured for my e-commerce service?"          |
| Purge cache         | "Purge the cache for my product service"                          |
| Check traffic       | "What's the traffic pattern for my main site over the last week?" |
| View configuration  | "Show me the backend servers for my API service"                  |
| Check performance   | "What's my current cache hit ratio?"                              |

### "What the traffic pattern my for services over the last week?"

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A Fastly account and API key ([Get started with Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/signup/))
- An AI assistant that supports MCP (e.g., Claude, GPT with plugins)
- The Fastly CLI installed ([Installation Guide](https://www.fastly.com/documentation/reference/cli/))

### Connect Your AI Assistant

Configure your AI assistant with:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fastly": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["path/to/fastly-mcp.mjs"],
      "env": {
        "FASTLY_API_KEY": "your_fastly_api_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
