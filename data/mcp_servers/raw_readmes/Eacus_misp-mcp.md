# MISP-mcp

## What is MCP?

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open protocol designed to standardize how applications provide contextual information to large language models (LLMs). Much like how **USB-C** serves as a universal interface for connecting hardware devices, **MCP acts as a universal connector** between AI models and various data sources or tools. This standardization simplifies integration and enhances the adaptability and functionality of AI-powered applications.

### Why MCP?

MCP helps you build agents and complex workflows on top of LLMs. LLMs frequently need to integrate with data and tools, and MCP provides:

- A growing list of pre-built integrations that your LLM can directly plug into
- The flexibility to switch between LLM providers and vendors
- Best practices for securing your data within your infrastructure

### General architecture

At its core, MCP follows a client-server architecture where a host application can connect to multiple servers:

- **MCP Hosts**: Programs like Claude Desktop, IDEs, or AI tools that want to access data through MCP
- **MCP Clients**: Protocol clients that maintain 1:1 connections with servers
- **MCP Servers**: Lightweight programs that each expose specific capabilities through the standardized Model Context Protocol
- **Local Data Sources**: Your computer’s files, databases, and services that MCP servers can securely access
- **Remote Services**: External systems available over the internet (e.g., through APIs) that MCP servers can connect to

## Get started

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Eacus/misp-mcp.git
```

2. Install [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download)

   1. Follow the guide https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user
   2. Add the following MCP configuration

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "MISP-mcp": {
         "command": "uv",
         "args": ["--directory", "<path_to_repo>/server/", "run", "server.py"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. Restart Claude desktop

## Basic Usage

### Search Event by ID

#### Prompting with `misp-mcp`

> Can you give to me the MISP event with id 119?

#### GUI

![image-20250409150858330](./imagemd/image-20250409150858330.png)

#### PyMISP

```python

misp_url = 'https://127.0.0.1:8443'
misp_key = '<misp_key>'
# Should PyMISP verify the MISP certificate
misp_verifycert = False
r = misp.search(eventid=[119], metadata=True, pythonify=True)
```

### Create an event

#### Prompting with `misp-mcp`

> Create a new MISP event with the following parameters:
>
> - Info: `This is my new MISP event`
> - Distribution: `0` (Your organization only)
> - Threat Level ID: `2` (Medium)
> - Analysis Level: `1` (Ongoing)

#### GUI

![image-20250409150904842](./imagemd/image-20250409150904842.png)

#### PyMISP

```python
from pymisp import MISPEvent

event = MISPEvent()

event.info = 'This is my new MISP event'  # Required
event.distribution = 0  # Optional, defaults to MISP.default_event_distribution in MISP config
event.threat_level_id = 2  # Optional, defaults to MISP.default_event_threat_level in MISP config
event.analysis = 1  # Optional, defaults to 0 (initial analysis)

print(event.to_json())
```

## Administrative task

### Create an user

#### Prompting with `misp-mcp`

> Add a new user to the MISP instance using the following required fields:
>
> - `email@email.com`: the email address associated with the account
> - `test_id`: the ID of the organization the user belongs to
> - `role_id`: the ID of the role assigned to the user

#### GUI

![image-20250409150913949](./imagemd/image-20250409150913949.png)

#### PyMisp

```python
from pymisp import ExpandedPyMISP, MISPUser
from keys import misp_url, misp_key, misp_verifycert
import argparse


    misp = ExpandedPyMISP(misp_url, misp_key, misp_verifycert, 'json')

    user = MISPUser()
    user.email = <email>
    user.org_id = <org_id>
    user.role_id = <role_id>

    misp.add_user(user, pythonify=True)
```
