# Category-based Memory Server

A basic implementation of persistent memory using a category-based memory system. This lets Claude remember information across chats by storing it in categorized memory entries.

## Core Concepts

### Categories

Categories are the primary organizational units in the memory system. Each category contains a collection of memories (pieces of information).

Example:

```json
"development": [
  "Uses pnpm for package management",
  "Prefers 2-space indentation"
]
```

### Tags

Tags provide additional context and grouping for memories within a category. They can be used to filter and find related memories.

Example:

```
# formatting style
Uses 2-space indentation
Prefers camelCase for variables
```

### Global vs Local Memories

The memory system supports two storage locations:

- **Global Memories**: Stored in the user's home directory (`~/.config/mcp-memory`) and persist across all projects.
- **Local Memories**: Stored in the current project directory (`.mcp-memory`) and are specific to the current project.

### Memory Storage

Memories are stored as text entries, with the following characteristics:

- Organized by categories (stored in separate files)
- Can be tagged for easier retrieval
- Stored in plain text files
- Can be added or removed independently
- Should be atomic (one piece of information per memory)

Example Memory File (`development.txt`):

```
# formatting style
Uses 2-space indentation
Prefers camelCase for variables

# tools
Uses eslint for linting
Uses prettier for formatting
```

## API

### Tools

- **remember_memory**

  - Stores a memory with optional tags in a specified category
  - Input:
    - `category` (string): The category to store the memory in
    - `data` (string): The data to store in memory
    - `tags` (string[], optional): Optional tags for categorizing the memory
    - `is_global` (boolean): Whether to store in global or local memory
  - Stores the memory entry in the specified category with optional tags

- **retrieve_memories**

  - Retrieves all memories from a specified category
  - Input:
    - `category` (string): The category to retrieve memories from, use '\*' for all categories
    - `is_global` (boolean): Whether to retrieve from global or local memory
  - Returns memories from the specified category, grouped by tags
  - Returns empty object if category doesn't exist

- **remove_memory_category**

  - Removes all memories within a specified category
  - Input:
    - `category` (string): The category to remove, use '\*' for all categories
    - `is_global` (boolean): Whether to remove from global or local memory
  - Removes the entire category file
  - Silent operation if category doesn't exist

- **remove_specific_memory**
  - Removes a specific memory within a specified category
  - Input:
    - `category` (string): The category containing the memory to remove
    - `memory_content` (string): Content of the memory to remove (partial match)
    - `is_global` (boolean): Whether to remove from global or local memory
  - Removes memories containing the specified content
  - Silent operation if memory doesn't exist

# Usage with Claude Desktop

### Setup

Add this to your claude_desktop_config.json:

#### npx

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@mkusaka/mcp-server-memory"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### npx with custom setting

The server can be configured using the following environment variables:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@mkusaka/mcp-server-memory"],
      "env": {
        "MEMORY_FILE_PATH": "/path/to/custom/memory.json"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- `MEMORY_FILE_PATH`: Path to the memory storage JSON file (default: `memory.json` in the server directory)

# VS Code Installation Instructions

For quick installation, use one of the one-click installation buttons below:

For manual installation, add the following JSON block to your User Settings (JSON) file in VS Code. You can do this by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + P` and typing `Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)`.

Optionally, you can add it to a file called `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace. This will allow you to share the configuration with others.

> Note that the `mcp` key is not needed in the `.vscode/mcp.json` file.

#### npx

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "memory": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["-y", "@mkusaka/mcp-server-memory"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```
