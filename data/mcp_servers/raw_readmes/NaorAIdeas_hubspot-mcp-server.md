# HubSpot MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation for HubSpot, providing a standardized interface for interacting with HubSpot's API.

## Overview

This package implements an MCP server that acts as a bridge between applications and HubSpot's API. It provides a standardized way to interact with HubSpot's services through the Model Context Protocol.

## Example Usage

Ever wondered how AI can transform your HubSpot workflow? Watch how these real-world scenarios come to life with just a simple conversation:

> 💡 **Sales & Project Management**
>
> _"I just had a great meeting with Sarah from TechCorp about their cloud migration project. Create a new deal for $250K, associate it with their company record, and schedule a follow-up call with their CTO next week to discuss the implementation timeline."_

> 🚀 **Client Onboarding**
>
> _"Our biggest client, Enterprise Solutions, is expanding their team. Create a new contact for their new CTO, link them to the 'Digital Transformation' project, and set up a series of onboarding meetings with our technical team over the next two weeks."_

> ⚡ **Project Handover**
>
> _"The 'AI Integration' project is moving to the final stage. Update the deal status, create a new support ticket for the handover process, and schedule a training session with the client's team for next month, making sure to include all relevant contacts from their IT department."_
